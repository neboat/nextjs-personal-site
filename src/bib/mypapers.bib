abstract = {Although randomized work stealing is effective at automatically load-balancing task-parallel programs, it can waste computational resources when scheduling programs that lack sufficient parallelism to use all available threads. For such programs, threads will waste cycles attempting to steal parallel tasks when none are available. This waste can reduce the machine’s efficiency by wasting computational resources and energy and needlessly burdening the operating system. This paper introduces WEWS, a simple, practical, and provably efficient extension to randomized work stealing that mitigates waste. WEWS dynamically adjusts the number of active threads to reduce the waste of randomized work stealing. WEWS executes a parallel computation with the same asymptotic running time as traditional randomized work stealing while bounding the waste to O(min{PT∞, T1 + P2}) instructions. WEWS also follows the work-first principle to perform well in practice. WEWS requires no special support from the operating system or hardware, which simplifies its implementation. We implemented WEWS within the OpenCilk runtime system and compared it to other common waste-mitigation strategies. Across 10 parallel benchmarks, we find that WEWS has minimal impact on parallel running times while, on programs with limited parallelism, substantially reducing waste.},

  abstract     = {In a randomized work-stealing scheduler, parallel speedup depends on the spawn overhead, which workers pay to allow tasks to execute in parallel, and the steal overhead, which thieves pay to start executing new work. The importance of minimizing the spawn overhead in a randomized work-stealing scheduler is first formalized by Frigo et al., coined as the work-first principle [15], which states that one should minimize spawn overhead even at the expense of a larger steal overhead. Since then, many strategies have been proposed to reduce the spawn overhead, which is dominated by maintaining a per-worker double-ended queue, or deque, to keep track of available parallel work.In pursuit of zero spawn overhead, this work considers a strategy that eliminates the use of deques entirely, obviating the need for a worker to perform explicit bookkeeping or set up a deque to enable parallelism. To that end, we propose DLite, a compiler and runtime ABI (Application Binary Interface) that incurs near-zero spawn overhead, empirically measured to be about 6\% compared to a regular function invocation. DLite pushes the tradeoffs advocated by the work-first principle to the extreme, which decreases the spawn overhead to almost nil, at the expense of a high steal cost. Specifically, DLite employs a backtracking strategy: When a steal attempt occurs, the victim provides its current stack and base pointers to the thief, and the thief then reconstructs the necessary state to realize the parallel execution.We have implemented Cilk-DLite, which extends the OpenCilk platform [33] to implement DLite. When the application has ample parallelism, Cilk-DLite exhibits similar scalability to OpenCilk with much lower spawn overhead. When the application lacks parallelism, the high steal cost in Cilk-DLite can impede scalability due to slower work distribution. We also implemented variants of Cilk-DLite that make different design choices to evaluate the tradeoffs between spawn overhead and steal cost.},

  optabstract  = {A multithreaded Cilk program that is ostensibly deterministic may nevertheless behave nondeterministically due to programming errors in the code. For a Cilk program that uses reducers—a general reduction mechanism supported in various Cilk dialects—such programming errors are especially challenging to debug, because the errors can expose the nondeterminism in how the Cilk runtime system manages reducers.We identify two unique types of races that arise from incorrect use of reducers in a Cilk program, and we present two algorithms to catch these races. The first algorithm, called the Peer-Set algorithm, detects view-read races, which occur when the program attempts to retrieve a value out of a reducer when the read may result in a nondeterministic value, such as before all previously spawned subcomputations that might update the reducer have necessarily returned. The second algorithm, called the SP+ algorithm, detects determinacy races—instances where a write to a memory location occurs logically in parallel with another access to that location—even when the raced-on memory locations relate to reducers. Both algorithms are provably correct, asymptotically efficient, and can be implemented efficiently in practice. We have implemented both algorithms in our prototype race detector, Rader. When running Peer-Set, Rader incurs a geometric-mean multiplicative overhead of 2.56 over running the benchmark without instrumentation. When running SP+, Rader incurs a geometric-mean multiplicative overhead of 16.94.},
