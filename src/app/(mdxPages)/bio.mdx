# Short biography

Tao B. Schardl is a Research Scientist at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) and a Principal Software Engineer at [Emerald Innovations](https://emeraldinno.com/).  He is Chief Architect of [OpenCilk](https://www.opencilk.org/), the latest open-source implementation of the Cilk task-parallel programming platform, and the technical lead for the [Supertech](https://supertech.mit.edu/) research group directed by [Professor Charles E. Leiserson](https://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/).  His research aims to make software performance engineering a viable replacement for Moore's Law.  His work integrates algorithms and systems and spans areas including parallel programming models, theories of performance, compilers, runtime systems, diagnostic tools, parallel algorithms, and trends in computer performance.  He received the US Department of the Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator Scientific Excellence Award in 2022 for his work on OpenCilk.  His work on the Tapir/LLVM compiler earned the best paper award at the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming in 2017.  His work on computer performance in the post-Moore's Law era was published in Science and has been spotlighted in two Turing-award lectures.  Dr. Schardl earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from MIT.
