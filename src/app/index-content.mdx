I am a Research Scientist at [MIT CSAIL](https://csail.mit.edu) and a Principal Software Engineer at [Emerald Innovations](https://emeraldinno.com/).  I am Chief Architect of [OpenCilk](https://www.opencilk.org), the newest open-source implementation of the Cilk task-parallel programming platform.  I am the technical lead for the [Supertech research group](https://supertech.mit.edu) within CSAIL.

My research aims to make software performance engineering a viable replacement for Moore's Law.  To that end, my work integrates algorithms and systems to develop technologies that enable principled, scientific approaches to parallel computing and software performance engineering.  My research spans multiple areas, including programming models, theories of software performance, compilers, runtime systems, diagnostic tools, parallel algorithms, and trends in computer performance.

My username of choice is `neboat`.  I'll let you guess what it means :)
